<h1>F.A.Q. for the Pixelmon Server</h1>
<h3><a id="connect"></a>How do I connect to the server?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the Technic Launcher: https://www.technicpack.net/download</li>
<li>Log in with your Mojang account</li>
<li>Install the Pixelmon Reforged Pack</li>
<li>Connect to our normal server address (16colorgames.com:25565)! You will be automatically redirected to the Pixelmon server</li>
</ol>
<h3>Minecrft keeps crashing when I try to connect!</h3>
<p>You probably have the 32-bit version of Java installed. Go <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">here</a> and get the 64-bit version for your system. You will need to make an Oracle account.</p>
<h3>What does the world look like/Is there a map?</h3>
<p><a href="http://16colorgames.com:8123">Here is the map</a></p>
<h3>How do I get pokeballs?</h3>
<p>The official Pixelmon wiki has a pretty good guide to get started. <a href="https://pixelmonmod.com/wiki/index.php?title=Pixelmon_tutorial#Time_to_catch_Pok.C3.A9mon">Check it out</a></p>
<h3>Whats up with the hunts?</h3>
<p>There are several pokemon hunts running at any given time. Using <code>/hunt</code> you can view the current ones. If you catch a pokemon currently being hunted and it has the specified nature, you will get several rare candies, some pokeballs, and occasionally some other useful items!</p>
<h3>Help! I fell in a mud pit/am lost/don't want to walk back!</h3>
<p>You can use the <code>/warps</code> command to view a list of available warps.</p>

<h2>I want to help out and get free stuff!</h2>
<h3>Gyms</h3>
<p>Natural gyms are spawning a large distance apart. If you want to help build big structures, you can help out here! Check out the map to see the distance between the Aubrey Gym and the (SECOND TOWN VOTE IN PROGRESS) Gym; this is roughly how far apart we would like the gyms to be. Build up a Gym themed around a specific type with room for at least 5 trainers, and contact oa10712 to recieve a random shiney of the type of gym you built!</p>
<h3>Themed Areas</h3>
<p>Unlike in the games, there are very few "man-made" structures with specific spawns. You can help out by building these. Some examples are the Power Plants, Sewers, and Ghost Towers from various games. These can be built in towns or preferably along routes. The bigger, the better with these structures, as we can create custom spawning rules for these structures. Contact oa10712 after building the structure to recieve a shiney from the spawnset of the new building!</p>
